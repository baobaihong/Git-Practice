One day, a wicked sorcerer named Zoltar came to the kingdom, seeking revenge against Aldric. Zoltar had been banished from Alveria many years ago for his evil deeds, and he had been plotting his revenge ever since.

Zoltar decided to kidnap Amara and hold her for ransom. He sent a message to Aldric, demanding that he hand over the kingdom's most valuable treasure in exchange for his daughter's safe return.
